# ðŸ’¡ Smart LED ON/OFF System
## ðŸ“‹ Description
This project demonstrates a **local-network-based IoT system** using a **Raspberry Pi**, where a **LED and an OLED display** are controlled from a **PC** through a Flask web application. While it doesn't use the internet, it mimics an IoT system architecture using a LAN.
> **Note:** This is technically not a full IoT implementation since it operates over a local network only.
